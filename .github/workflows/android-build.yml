# Android Build and Release Workflow
# 
# This workflow builds the Medicine Reminder Android app and creates GitHub releases.
# 
# Triggers:
#   - Push to master branch: Builds and creates a release
#   - Pull requests to master: Builds only (no release)
#
# Build outputs:
#   - APK: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
#   - AAB: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
#
# Requirements:
#   - JDK 17 (compatible with JVM target 1.8)
#   - Android SDK
#   - Gradle 8.7.2
#
# Notes:
#   - Uses Gradle daemon for faster builds
#   - Caches Gradle dependencies to speed up subsequent builds
#   - Generates unsigned release builds (signing should be added for production)

    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
    # fetch-depth: 0 ensures full git history for proper versioning
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    # Step 2: Set up Java Development Kit
    # Using JDK 17 (Temurin distribution) which is compatible with JVM target 1.8
    # Gradle cache is enabled to speed up dependency resolution
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    # Step 3: Set up Android SDK
    # Required for Android-specific build tools and platform APIs
    - name: Setup Android SDK
      uses: android-actions/setup-android@v3

    # Step 4: Configure Gradle for CI environment
    # Appends CI-specific optimizations to gradle.properties:
    #   - Xmx4g: Allocate 4GB heap memory for Gradle
    #   - UseG1GC: Use G1 garbage collector for better performance
    #   - parallel: Enable parallel project execution
    #   - caching: Enable Gradle build cache
